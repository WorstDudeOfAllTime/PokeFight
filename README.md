What it is: An app to compare one's self to Pokemon
End Goal: The End goal of this project is to allow users to upload a photo, stats, and move-sets and to
have a fully functional comparison system ultimately providing them with their chances should they encounter the creature in the wild

Currently, the idea is to compare oneself as human vs pokemon as they are; however, this feels a bit limiting in the sense
of standard weight divisions.
A potential feature could allow users to completey customize their moveset and "type" and have comparisons be more
akin to the Pokemon universe.
Both seem fun. Stay tuned.
